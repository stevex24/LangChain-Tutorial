# LangChain Tutorial — Gemini Experiments

This repository contains a series of small LangChain-Gemini experiments for a game research course.

- **Limerick Generator:** Creates a limerick about game programming.  
- **Limerick Revision:** Resubmits the poem for self-editing to improve rhythm and meter.  
- **JSON Example:** Produces structured JSON output about AI design principles.  
- **GGP Planning Example:** Outlines, at a conceptual level, how one might design an open-source AlphaZero-style system for the game *Yavalath.*

*Note:* The earliest branch (Groq) was used only for setup testing—useful for getting all the early mistakes out of the way before things started working properly.
